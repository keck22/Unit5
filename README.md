# Unit5
Executive Summary

Explain the goal for this lab

LucidChart

Lucidchart in my opnion is a little clunky to get used to. 
I first did not understand what I was trying to do and what shapes to use (still not sure) so when I made a mistake it sometimes was hard to get rid of a shape I added. 
This was typically after I clicked off the shape after adding it which gave me the most problems. 
I think this could be a very cool way to introduce a topic to a class but it almost feels as if the website is still in beta. 

# Networking

## Intro to Networking

## Data Transmission

DNS Protocol - Set of rules to allow devices to communicate Unit of data
IP Address -  Unique identifying number
Packet Packet-Switching - Technology that allows packets of data to be routed based on destination address Directory of IP address common names. (For example 54.239.26.214 might be the IP address of amazon.com)

## Network Hardware

The benefit of a switch over a hub is it maximizes the security and efficientcy of the network
Hubs and switches connect multiple componets to create a local area networl while a router connects a local network to another network
Network Topology

A single point of failure is when multiple computures are connected to a central wiring point and the central wiring point then fails causing all of the computures connected to be affected. 
I think the wireless mesh topology is the best becuase it offers multiple connections on each device so if something shuts down it can handle failure very well.
Cybersecurity and Encryption

Imagine you are part of the Amazon.com online chat. Explain how each component of the security triad would impact your job
Identify three daily tasks that require authentication. Explain how each one could be converted to multi-factor authentication
Explain ACL and RBAC. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each?
Explain the interaction of ciphertext, a public key and a private key
Explain why we need public key cryptography.
Cryptography

I typed "My name is Caleb" I then set the encyrption lock to convert a to i. The message then read "ug vium qa kitmj"

The result I got from typing a message in the frequency fingerprint exploration was "i" was the most used letter in my statement. This is probably because I wrote my message in first person to be fair. 
I think it would probably equal out to what they are saying if I wrote more than a few sentences. 
I also do believe it would be different in different langues. Use spanish for an example. Hola mi llamo Caleb. There is only one "e" in this statement.
Also thinking about y in spanish meaning and would shift the scale as well. 


What is a "Polyalphabetic cipher?" Type a message in the "Polyalphabetic Exploration" box as well as a shift word. Explain the result.
Polyalphabetic cipher uses a shift word to encrypt a message. This makes it much harder to break the encryption because now it has been encrypted in two different ways.
The reason behind encrypting a message in two ways is to flatten the use of the letter "e" and maybe use the letter "z" more. 
I typed "Hello this is Caleb" then used the shift word "tank" and the result I got was bfzwi uvtm jg numsm.

# Brute Force

Brute-Force tries every possible decryption key for a cipher this is so good that is makes uses Ceasers cypher useless. Although Kerckhoff's principle says that the cipher is still secure even if they know the decryption. 
Conclusion

This Lab taught us how encrypting and decrypting works. This was by far the thing that interested me the most in this lab, as I really enjoyed learning the origins of secret messages and how to break them!
